<h2>Analyst-Driven Geocoding</h2>
<div class="row collapse" id="description">
<p>
To obtain population counts for each ad location, we need to look up each
place in a canonical database, a process called geocoding. Sometimes
place names fail to resolve automatically--those are the places in the
"Failed to Geocode" selection box. Other times, places are geocoded
incorrectly. The "Geocoded Places" selection contains both correct codings
as well as mistakes. It was ordered in descending order from the most
likely to be erroneous to the least, based off of our expectation of
what the ratio of ad counts to the population should look like.
The most egregious ratios are highlighted in red.

<p>
To geocode a location, select it, and begin typing its name in the
search box that appears. Some legwork may be required to figure out
the canonical name for a location. For example, the Wikipedia page for
"Inland Empire, CA" reveals that it is actually called the "Riverside-San
Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area".  Select the most accurate name
from the autocomplete dropdown, and press enter or "Accept".

<p>
Our current data source (the US Census) has no information on non-US
locations. Those should be discarded.  To discard a place, select it, and
press the discard button. No data is deleted from the server.
